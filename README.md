I have created the Automation script using BDD cucumber . 

Tech stacks i have used 

Language - Java 17
Framework - BDD Cucumber 
Testing framewokr - Junit 
Rest API libs - Rest assured 

Execution -> For running the test script we need to run the class Test Runner as junit also we can define the resp rtag we need to run as test case

Feature file -> This file does have test scenario with test steps 

testdata.properties -> This file i stored all URLs for api and also calling them inside the framework 

stepDefination -> Class file have test case execution steps as methods 

API utils -> This is generic class file which handles type of request such as get , post , put and delete for test case operations 

target -> extent report will get generate inside this package 

Coverage -> Test coverage since there is very shorter time i have covered straight forward functionaliy that is Creat user , create message , update message and delete message as a single flow .
